DOUGCAST - HOW IT ALL WORKS
============================

THE PLAYERS
-----------

1. CLAUDE CODE
   A robot assistant that writes code based on your instructions.
   It saves files to your computer and can upload them to the internet.

2. YOUR COMPUTER
   The actual code files live in: /Users/dwb/Documents/DougCast/
   - index.html (the app)
   - sw.js (offline helper/service worker)
   - manifest.json (app info for installing)

3. GITHUB
   Think of GitHub as Google Drive for code.
   - Code is uploaded (pushed) to: github.com/dwbonham/dougcast
   - GitHub Pages hosts the website for free at: dwbonham.github.io/dougcast
   - Microsoft/GitHub pays for hosting - it's free for public projects

4. FIREBASE (GOOGLE)
   Does two things:

   a) Authentication (Login)
      - Handles "Sign in with Google"
      - Remembers who you are
      - Google handles all passwords/security

   b) Firestore (Cloud Database)
      - Stores your subscriptions in the cloud
      - "Sync Now" saves your podcast list to Google's servers
      - Logging in on another device downloads your list


WHERE DATA LIVES
----------------

| Data                  | Where it's stored                              |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| App code              | GitHub (and your Mac)                          |
| Website hosting       | GitHub Pages                                   |
| Your subscriptions    | Browser (localStorage) + Firebase cloud        |
| Downloaded episodes   | Browser (IndexedDB) - STAYS ON THAT DEVICE     |
| Podcast audio files   | Podcast's own servers (Megaphone, Spotify)     |
| Login info            | Firebase Authentication                        |


HOW IT WORKS WHEN YOU USE IT
----------------------------

1. You open the app -> Browser loads website from GitHub Pages
2. You search "Bill Simmons" -> App asks iTunes API -> Shows podcasts
3. You subscribe -> Saved to browser's localStorage
4. You click "Sync Now" -> Uploads subscription list to Firebase
5. You play an episode -> Streams audio from podcast's server
6. You download an episode -> Audio saved to browser storage (IndexedDB)


IF ANOTHER PERSON WANTS TO USE THIS APP
---------------------------------------

Option A: Use YOUR app (easy)
   - Just go to dwbonham.github.io/dougcast
   - They sign into YOUR Firebase project
   - Their data is in YOUR Firebase database
   - Downloads stay on their own device

Option B: Make their own copy (better)
   1. "Fork" your GitHub repository (copy the code)
   2. Create their own Firebase project
   3. Update the Firebase config keys in the code
   4. Enable GitHub Pages on their repo
   Then they have their own separate app.


SIMPLE DIAGRAM
--------------

YOUR PHONE/COMPUTER
    |
    v loads website from
GITHUB PAGES (free hosting)
    |
    v app code asks
iTUNES API ---------> podcast search results
RSS2JSON API -------> episode lists
PODCAST SERVERS ----> actual audio files
    |
    v saves your data to
FIREBASE (Google) --> subscriptions sync across devices
YOUR BROWSER -------> downloaded episodes (local only)


KEY POINTS
----------

- GitHub = stores and hosts the code (free)
- Firebase = login + cloud sync for subscriptions (free)
- Downloads = stored in YOUR browser only, don't sync between devices
- Audio files = streamed from podcast companies, not stored by us
- Cost to you = $0


FIREBASE CONFIG (for reference)
-------------------------------

Project: dougcast-9eb17
API Key: AIzaSyANL62rPXmWku8DuJ2LYEgbmBVMf-gwmdg
Auth Domain: dougcast-9eb17.firebaseapp.com
Project ID: dougcast-9eb17


GITHUB REPO
-----------

Repository: github.com/dwbonham/dougcast
Live Site: dwbonham.github.io/dougcast


MULTIPLE USERS & FIREBASE LIMITS
---------------------------------

When Someone Else Uses Your App:
- They go to dwbonham.github.io/dougcast
- They sign in with THEIR own Google account
- Their data is stored in YOUR Firebase project (dougcast-9eb17)
- Each user's data is separate (they can only see their own subscriptions)

So: Your Firebase account, their Google login, separate data.


Firebase Free Tier Limits (Spark Plan):

| Resource           | Free Limit    | What it means                          |
|--------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| Users              | Unlimited     | No limit on sign-ups                   |
| Firestore Storage  | 1 GB          | ~10,000+ users worth of subscriptions  |
| Firestore Reads    | 50,000/day    | Loading subscriptions                  |
| Firestore Writes   | 20,000/day    | Clicking "Sync Now"                    |
| Bandwidth          | 10 GB/month   | Data transferred                       |


What This Means Practically:
- 5-10 friends using it? No problem
- 100 users? Still fine
- 1,000+ daily users? Might hit limits
- Goes viral? Need to upgrade to paid plan


If You Hit Limits:
- Firebase stops working temporarily (won't charge you)
- You'll see "quota exceeded" errors
- Fix by waiting until next day (limits reset) or upgrading to Blaze plan


Your Cost Right Now: $0
Well within free limits for personal use and sharing with friends.


Privacy Note:
As Firebase project owner, you CAN technically see other users'
subscription lists in Firebase console (but not their Google passwords).
For true separation, each person would need their own Firebase project.
